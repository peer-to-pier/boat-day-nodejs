In order to establish a participation request pending the applicable Host’s confirmation of Your request, You understand and agree that Peer to Pier reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization via Your credit card for the Contribution or (ii) charge Your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed one dollar ($1), to verify Your credit card. Once Peer to Pier receives confirmation of Your Contribution, Peer to Pier (or its third-party payment processor) will collect the Contribution in accordance with this Agreement and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Listing.
